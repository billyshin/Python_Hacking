Backdoors sockets:
    Problem:
        1. TCP is stream based
        2. Difficult to identify the end of message/batch

    Solution:
        1. Make sure the message is well defined
        2. Implement a protocol that sends and receives methods conform to
            - send size of mesaage as header
            - append a end-of-message mark to the end of each message
            - serialize the message

Backdoors serialization:
    Benefits:
        1. Message is well defined, receiver knows if message is incomplete
        2. Can be used to transfer objects (list,s dicts, ...)

    Client(sample long data to send ove tcp stream) -> Packing -> Server(Unpack)
        Client: converts obejct to a stream of well-defined bytes
        Server: converts well-defined stream of bytes back into an object

    Implementation:
        1. Json(Javascript Object Notation) and Pickle are common solutions
        2. Represents objects as text
        3. widely used when transferring data between clients and servers
